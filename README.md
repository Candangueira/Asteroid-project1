# 😱 Bugs to fix 💩

-   Bugs in the movement, diagonals goes faster than straight lines.
-   If you dont move the cursor it doesnt aims.
-   The collisions in the Asteroids are a bit off.

## Buttons to not click too many times (cause its broken 😒)

-   Restart Button spawns too many Asteroids.

# ✅ Future features
