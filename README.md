# 🚀 Cool tech

Javascript, HTML and CSS.

# 😱 Bugs to fix 💩

-   Bugs in the movement, diagonals goes faster than straight lines.
-   If you dont move the cursor it doesnt aims.
-   The collisions in the Asteroids are a bit off.

# 😭 Lessons learnt

-   I would focus on the essencial parts first, and leave the details and optimization for later.
-   Nothing is as easy as it looks.
-   Sometimes taking a break can lead to breakthroughs in your project.

# ✅ Future features

-   Add inercia.
-   Splitting asteroids when hit by a projectile.
-   Smoother movement.
-   Main menu screen.
-   Adding difficulty.
